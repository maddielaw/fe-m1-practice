1.  On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
* The purpose of HTML code is to give structure to a website so that readers can navigate and understand the information being conveyed.
2.  What is the difference between an element and a tag?
* An element tells the browser information about how to structure the page - it includes an opening tag and a closing tag as well as text in between. A tag tells the browser where that element begins and ends.
3.  Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
* Attributes tell us additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and include a name and a value.
4.  Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
* These elements can create the structure of the page. Body is what is shown in the browser itself, the Head element gives info about the page rather than the info that's shown in browser, and Title is shown at the top of the browser.
5.  In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
* I would navigate to View -> Developer -> View Source
6.  List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
* <h1></h1> = Main Heading
* <p></p> = paragraph
* <b></b> = bold
* <i></i> = italicize
* <hr /> = horizontal rule
7.  What are empty elements?
* An empty element does not have any words between an opening and closing tag. Usually only has one tag.
8.  What is semantic markup?
* Text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of the page but add extra info to the page.
9.  What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
* <aside></aside> = Aside, used inside Article element and contains info related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning
* <article></article> = Article, acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated
* <nav></nav> = Navigation, used to contain the major navigational blocks on a site
